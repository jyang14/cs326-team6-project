## Project Idea: Refrigerator Tracker App
### Need
* We don't know what do we have in the fridge when we go to supermarket.
* There might be expired food in the fridge. These food waste the space of fridge till we find out that they are expired food.
* If people share rent, it hard to know the food each person own. As a result, some food might stay in the fridge forever.
* If we have multiple fridge or our fridge is divided into several block, it might waste a lot of time searching the food we want.
