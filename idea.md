problem need to solve:
1. We don't know what do we have in the fridge when we go to supermarket.
2. There might be expired food in the fridge. These food waste the space of fridge till we find out that they are expired food.
3. If people share rent, it hard to know the food each person own. As a result, some food might stay in the fridge forever.
4. If we have multiple fridge or our fridge is divided into several block, it might waste a lot of time searching the food we want.

solution:
A website.
- login and check all food he/she own(show the position, expired time and food name).
- show all expired food
- search food
